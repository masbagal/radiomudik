# Radio Mudik

It all started when a colleague shares their 8 hour `mudik journey from Tangerang to East Java` video. Another colleague jokingly said that it can be made into similar web to https://nyetirdanradio.com/ that play the video while streaming the radio to simulate a road trip.

Me, for refreshing decided to randomly make it.

That's all. This is a random project.
